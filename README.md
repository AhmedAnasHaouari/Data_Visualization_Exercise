# Visualization: Average Age of Women at First Marriage vs. State Population Density (2015-2019)
## Overview
This visualization explores the relationship between the average age of women at first marriage and the population density of U.S. states for the period 2015-2019. The goal is to understand if there is any correlation between the two variables and to visualize any potential patterns or trends.

## Data
The data used for this visualization is sourced from a dataset downloaded from the site Makeovermonday. It contains information about the average age of women at first marriage by state and the population density of each state. The dataset provides insights into demographic trends and population distribution in the United States.

## Visualization
Average Age vs. Population Density
The scatter plot above shows the relationship between the average age of women at first marriage (in years) on the x-axis and the population density (people per square mile) on the y-axis. Each data point represents a U.S. state. Here's what the visualization tells us:

### X-Axis (Average Age of Women at First Marriage): 
The x-axis represents the average age at which women in each state get married for the first time. The range is between 24 and 31 years.

### Y-Axis (Population Density): 
The y-axis represents the population density of each state.

### Data Points: 
Each data point on the scatter plot represents a specific state. 

### Gridlines: 
Gridlines are provided on both the x and y-axes to aid in reading values from the plot.

### Background: 
The figure has a gray background, and the plot area has a lighter gray background for better contrast.

### Styling: 
Spines (axis borders) are removed from the top, bottom, and left sides to provide a cleaner appearance. Ticks and tick labels are also removed from these sides to avoid redundancy.

## Interpretation
This visualization allows us to explore whether there is a relationship between the average age of women at first marriage and the population density of U.S. states. By examining the scatter plot, we can draw initial observations and hypotheses about any potential correlations or trends. Further statistical analysis may be required to draw more robust conclusions.
Please note that this is an exploratory visualization, and additional context and analysis may be needed to fully understand any underlying factors contributing to the observed patterns.
